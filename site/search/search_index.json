Differentiate between 'Hazard' and 'Disaster' with suitable examples. (click to see key points) Click to see Key Points Key Points: - Hazard: A potential threat or event (e.g., a flood in an uninhabited area). It is the cause. - Disaster: The actual event causing significant loss of life and property, exceeding local coping capacity (e.g., a flood in a city). It is the consequence. - Crucial Difference: Coping capacity. Hazard + Vulnerability - Capacity = Disaster.  2. Explain the concept of 'Vulnerability' and discuss its different types (Physical, Social, Economic). (click to see key points) Click to see Key Points Key Points: - Definition: Conditions that increase susceptibility to hazard impacts. - Physical: Weak housing, location in risk zones. - Social: Marginalization, lack of education, discrimination, age/gender factors. - Economic: Poverty, lack of insurance/savings, reliance on single income source. - Environmental: Deforestation, soil degradation leading to loss of natural buffers.  3. Discuss the 'Pressure and Release (PAR)' Model of Disaster. (click to see key points) Click to see Key Points Key Points: - Concept: Disaster is the intersection of 'Progression of Vulnerability' and a 'Hazard'. - Stage 1 (Root Causes): Systemic issues (e.g., economic system, ideologies). - Stage 2 (Dynamic Pressures): Processes like urbanization, population growth, lack of institutions. - Stage 3 (Unsafe Conditions): Specific manifestations like living in a slum on a hill. - Release: Reducing disaster risk involves reversing these pressures (addressing root causes).  4. Compare Structural vs. Non-Structural Mitigation measures.
