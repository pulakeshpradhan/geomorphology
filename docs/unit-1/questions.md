<details>
<summary>Click to see Key Points</summary>
<strong>Key Points:</strong><br>
- <strong>Hazard:</strong> A potential threat or event (e.g., a flood in an uninhabited area). It is the cause.<br>
- <strong>Disaster:</strong> The actual event causing significant loss of life and property, exceeding local coping capacity (e.g., a flood in a city). It is the consequence.<br>
- <strong>Crucial Difference:</strong> Coping capacity. Hazard + Vulnerability - Capacity = Disaster.

<strong>Key Points:</strong><br>
- <strong>Concept:</strong> Disaster is the intersection of 'Progression of Vulnerability' and a 'Hazard'.<br>
- <strong>Stage 1 (Root Causes):</strong> Systemic issues (e.g., economic system, ideologies).<br>
- <strong>Stage 2 (Dynamic Pressures):</strong> Processes like urbanization, population growth, lack of institutions.<br>
- <strong>Stage 3 (Unsafe Conditions):</strong> Specific manifestations like living in a slum on a hill.<br>
- <strong>Release:</strong> Reducing disaster risk involves reversing these pressures (addressing root causes).
