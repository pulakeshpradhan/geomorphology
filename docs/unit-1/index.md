# Unit I: Foundations of Geomorphology

## Introduction

This unit serves as the foundational pillar for understanding Geomorphology. Before delving into advanced geomorphic modeling, it is imperative to grasp the core concepts of Earth's surface processes. In this unit, we explore the dynamic interaction between geological forces and climatic factors, mapping out how the landscape is continuously shaped and transformed over time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

1. **Define and Differentiate:** Clearly distinguish between a 'Hazard' and a 'Disaster' using official international and national definitions.
2. **Classify Hazards:** Categorize hazards into natural and manmade, and further into specific sub-types (geological, hydrological, etc.).
3. **Analyze Risk:** Understand the Risk Equation ($Risk = Hazard \times Vulnerability / Capacity$) and its implications.
4. **Understand Key Mechanisms:** Grasp the concepts of prevention, mitigation, and management as proactive measures.

## Unit Outline

* **[Concept of Hazards and Disasters](concept-hazards-disasters.md)**: Official definitions and conceptual frameworks.
* **[Natural and Manmade Hazards](natural-manmade-hazards.md)**: Exploring the origins of hazards.
* **[Types of Hazards](types-of-hazards.md)**: Detailed classification of specific hazards.
* **[Concept of Vulnerability and Risk](vulnerability-risk.md)**: The physics and sociology of disaster risk.
* **[Prevention, Mitigation, and Management](prevention-mitigation.md)**: The triad of risk reduction.
