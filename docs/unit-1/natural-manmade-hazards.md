# Natural and Manmade Hazards: A Detailed Spectrum

## Introduction

The distinction between **"Natural"** and **"Manmade"** hazards is becoming increasingly complex in the **Anthropocene**—the current geological epoch where human activity is the dominant influence on climate and the environment. While we traditionally classify hazards by their origin, the reality is often a hybrid. A flood may be triggered by rain (natural), but its devastation is often caused by blocked drains, encroachment on riverbeds, and poor urban planning (manmade).

This document explores the full spectrum of hazards, from those purely of natural origin to those entirely manufactured by human activity, and the dangerous intersection between them known as **"Socio-Natural"** hazards. Understanding this spectrum is crucial for modern disaster management, as the strategies for mitigation differ significantly based on the root cause. For a natural hazard, we focus on *adaptation and resilience*; for a manmade hazard, we focus on *regulation, safety standards, and enforcement*.

## 1. Natural Hazards

Natural hazards are severe and extreme weather and climate events that occur naturally in all parts of the world. (See *Types of Hazards* for detailed classification). While humans cannot prevent the occurrence of these events (we cannot stop an earthquake or cyclone), human activity can influence their frequency and intensity (e.g., climate change increasing storm severity).

### The "Socio-Natural" Concept (The Hybrid Hazard)

A **Socio-Natural Hazard** is a phenomenon that appears natural but is actually induced or exacerbated by human activity. This term acknowledges that human intervention in the environment often creates or amplifies risks.

#### Key Examples of Socio-Natural Hazards

1. **Urban Flooding:**
    * **Natural Factor:** Heavy rainfall.
    * **Human Factor:** "Concretization" of cities prevents water absorption; clogging of storm water drains with plastic; encroachment on wetlands and natural sinks.
    * **Result:** Even moderate rain causes severe flooding in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, and Bengaluru.

2. **Landslides in Hilly Terrain:**
    * **Natural Factor:** Gravity and slope instability.
    * **Human Factor:** Deforestation removes the roots that bind soil; road cutting destabilizes slopes; construction of heavy hotels on fragile ecosystems.
    * **Result:** Catastrophic landslides in states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand (e.g., Joshimath sinking).

3. **Smog:**
    * **Natural Factor:** Temperature inversion and low wind speed (fog).
    * **Human Factor:** Vehicular emissions, industrial smoke, crop burning (stubble burning).
    * **Result:** Severe air pollution episodes in Delhi-NCR during winter, impacting public health.

4. **Induced Seismicity:**
    * **Natural Factor:** Existing fault lines.
    * **Human Factor:** Large dams (Reservoir Induced Seismicity - e.g., Koyna Earthquake 1967), fracking for oil/gas, underground nuclear testing.
    * **Result:** Earthquakes triggered by human engineering.

## 2. Manmade (Anthropogenic) Hazards

Manmade hazards are events that are caused by humans and occur in or close to human settlements. They can be the result of **Intent** (terrorism, war), **Negligence** (industrial failure, lack of maintenance), or **Error** (oil spills, transport accidents).

### A. Technological Hazards (CBRN Focus)

Technological hazards are often associated with the breakdown of systems or processes. The most critical sub-category is **CBRN** (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), which poses threats of mass destruction.

#### 1. Chemical Hazards (C)

Chemical hazards involve the unexpected release of toxic substances that have immediate and long-term effects on health and the environment.

* **Types of Chemical Agents:**
  * **Nerve Agents:** Highly toxic chemicals that disrupt the nervous system (e.g., Sarin, VX).
  * **Blister Agents:** Cause severe chemical burns to skin and lungs (e.g., Mustard Gas).
  * **Choking Agents:** Damage the respiratory tract (e.g., Chlorine, Phosgene).
  * **Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs):** Common chemicals used in factories like Ammonia, Chlorine, and Methyl Isocyanate (MIC).

* **Causes:**
  * Industrial accidents (leakages, explosions).
  * Transportation accidents (tanker rollovers, train derailments).
  * Improper storage and disposal of hazardous waste.

!!! danger "Deep Dive: The Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)"
    ***Date:** December 2-3, 1984.
    *   **Location:** Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.
    ***Event:** Leak of **Methyl Isocyanate (MIC)** gas from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant.
    *   **Impact:** Official death toll ~3,000 immediately; estimated 15,000-20,000 total deaths due to long-term effects. Over 500,000 people exposed, suffering from blindness, respiratory issues, and genetic defects.
    *   **Significance:** Considered the **world's worst industrial disaster**. It led to the enactment of the **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986** and the **Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991** in India.

#### 2. Biological Hazards (B) (Manmade Aspect)

While viruses act naturally, "Biological Warfare" or "Bioterrorism" is the intentional use of pathogens to cause harm.

* **Definition:** The use of biological agents (bacteria, viruses, toxins) as weapons.
* **Categories of Bio-Agents (CDC Classification):**
  * **Category A (High Priority):** Anthrax, Botulism, Plague, Smallpox, Tularemia, Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (Ebola). High mortality, easy dissemination.
  * **Category B (Moderate):** Ricin toxin, Q fever, Typhus. Moderate morbidity, low mortality.
  * **Category C (Emerging):** Nipah virus, Hantavirus. Pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination.

* **Notable Incident:**
  * **Anthrax Attacks (2001):** Letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to media offices and Senators in the US, killing 5 people and causing widespread panic.

#### 3. Radiological Hazards (R)

Radiological hazards involve the dispersal of radioactive material **without** a nuclear detonation.

* **Dirty Bombs (Radiological Dispersal Devices - RDDs):**
  * **Mechanism:** Conventional explosives (dynamite) spiked with radioactive material (e.g., Cobalt-60, Cesium-137 from medical equipment).
  * **Impact:** The blast kills locally (kinetic energy), but the primary threat is the *dispersal* of radiation, causing panic, long-term contamination, and area denial (economic disruption). It is a "Weapon of Mass Disruption" rather than mass destruction.

#### 4. Nuclear Hazards (N)

Nuclear hazards involve the fission or fusion of atoms, releasing immense energy.

* **Nuclear Weapons:**
  * **Effects:** Intense light discharge (flash), Thermal radiation (heat wave), Blast wave (shock), and Residual Nuclear Radiation (Fallout).
  * **Example:** Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945).

* **Nuclear Accidents (Civilian):**
  * **Core Meltdown:** Failure of cooling systems in a nuclear reactor leading to overheating and melting of fuel rods.
  * **The "Big Three" Accidents:**
        1. **Three Mile Island (1979, USA):** Partial meltdown, rated Level 5 on INES.
        2. **Chernobyl (1986, USSR):** Explosion and fire, rated Level 7 (Maximum). Widespread contamination across Europe. Causes: Flawed design + Human error.
        3. **Fukushima Daiichi (2011, Japan):** Multi-reactor meltdown triggered by Tsunami. Rated Level 7.

### B. Sociological Hazards (Social Instability)

These hazards arise from human interaction, social structures, and political dynamics. They differ from technological hazards as they are driven by *behavior* rather than *physics*.

#### 1. Crowd Disasters (Stampedes)

* **Definition:** A surge in a crowd that leads to people being crushed or trampled.
* **Mechanism:** It is rarely "panic" (flight response). It is usually "craze" (rush towards something) or "turbulence" (collapse of space).
* **Cause of Death:** **Compressive Asphyxia** (pressure on the chest preventing breathing), not trampling.
* **Critical Density:** At >6 people per square meter, the crowd behaves like a fluid. Shockwaves can ripple through the crowd causing people to fall in domino fashion.
* **Examples:**
  * **Religion:** Kumbh Mela, Hajj (Mina stampede).
  * **Entertainment:** Concerts (e.g., Astroworld 2021).
  * **Politics/Protests:** Rallies.
* **Mitigation:** Crowd flow management, sectoral division, emergency exits, avoiding bottlenecks.

#### 2. Civil Unrest & Conflict

* **Riots:** Violent disturbance of peace by a synchronized crowd. Can be communal, political, or economic.
* **Terrorism:** The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
  * **Tactics:** Bombings, hijackings, kidnappings, cyber-attacks, and CBRN threats.
* **War:** Large-scale armed conflict between states or groups. Leads to displacement, famine, and infrastructure collapse.

---

### C. Transport Hazards

Accidents involving the systems we use to move people and goods.

#### 1. Road Accidents

* **Scale:** According to the WHO, road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death globally (approx. 1.3 million deaths/year).
* **India Context:** India accounts for about 11% of global road deaths despite having only 1% of the world's vehicles.

#### 2. Maritime Accidents

* **Oil Spills:** Release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons into the marine environment.
  * **Impact:** Destroys marine life (coating birds/fish), damages coral reefs, ruins tourism, and enters the food chain.
  * **Examples:** *Exxon Valdez* (1989), *Deepwater Horizon* (2010), *MV Wakashio* (2020).

#### 3. Aviation Accidents

* **Characteristics:** High fatality rate per accident, though frequency is low compared to road transport.
* **Causes:** Mechanical failure, pilot error, weather conditions, or sabotage.

## 3. The "Natech" Hazard (Converging Risks)

**Natech** stands for **Natural Hazards triggering Technological Disasters**. This concept highlights the cascading nature of modern risks—specifically how a natural event can compromise industrial infrastructure, leading to a secondary technological disaster.

### The Mechanism of Natech

1. **Primary Event:** A Natural Hazard occurs (e.g., Earthquake, Flood, Lightning).
2. **Impact on Infrastructure:** The event damages hazardous installations (pipelines, storage tanks, power plants, chemical factories).
3. **Secondary Event:** Hazardous materials are released (spill, gas leak, fire, explosion, radiation).
4. **Compound Impact:** The emergency response is hampered because roads/comms are already damaged by the natural event, making the technological disaster harder to contain.

### Historic Natech Examples

* **Fukushima Daiichi (2011):**
  * **Natural Event:** Tsunami (triggered by Earthquake).
  * **Technological Failure:** Flooding of diesel generators $\rightarrow$ Loss of power $\rightarrow$ Pump failure $\rightarrow$ Reactor Meltdown.
* **Kocaeli Earthquake (1999, Turkey):**
  * **Natural Event:** Earthquake.
  * **Technological Failure:** Massive fire at the Tupras oil refinery, releasing toxic smoke and threatening storage tanks.
* **Texas Floods (Hurricane Harvey, 2017):**
  * **Natural Event:** Flooding.
  * **Technological Failure:** Chemical plant (Arkema) lost refrigeration for organic peroxides $\rightarrow$ Explosion and fire.

## 4. Complex Emergencies

A **Complex Emergency** is a humanitarian crisis in a country, region, or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency.

### Key Characteristics (IASC Definition)

1. **Extensive Violence:** Often involve armed conflict or civil war.
2. **Displacement:** Massive movements of people, creating Refugees (cross-border) and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs - within borders).
3. **Breakdown of Systems:** Collapse of economic, political, and social order.
4. **Humanitarian Need:** Widespread famine, disease, and lack of basic services.
5. **Security Risks:** Aid workers are often targeted or cannot access affected areas.

### Examples

* **Syria Crisis:** Civil war leading to millions of refugees, destroyed healthcare, and chemical weapon use.
* **Yemen:** Conflict + Cholera outbreak + Famine.
* **Sudan (Darfur):** Conflict and displacement.

---

## 5. Environmental Hazards (Slow-Onset)

These hazards relate to the degradation of the environment, which in turn acts as a driver for other hazards. They usually occur over a long period (creeping hazards).

* **Pollution:**
  * **Air:** Smog, Particulate Matter (PM2.5).
  * **Water:** Contamination of rivers (e.g., Yamuna froth), Arsenic in groundwater.
  * **Soil:** Excessive pesticide use, industrial dumping.
* **Desertification:** Land degradation in arid/semi-arid areas resulting from climatic variations and human activities (overgrazing).
* **Deforestation:** Loss of forest cover increasing vulnerability to floods, soil erosion, and landslides.
* **Climate Change:** The overarching "risk multiplier" or "threat multiplier" that intensifies hydro-meteorological hazards (stronger cyclones, hotter heatwaves).

### Descriptive Questions

1. **Differentiate between Radiological and Nuclear hazards.**
    <details>
    <summary>Click to see Key Points</summary>
    *   **Nuclear:** Involves a fission/fusion explosion (atomic bomb) or reactor meltdown. It creates a massive blast wave, intense thermal heat (fireball), and releases new radioactive isotopes (fallout). It causes mass destruction of infrastructure.
    *   **Radiological:** Involves mainly the dispersal of pre-existing radioactive material (e.g., from hospital waste) using conventional explosives (Dirty Bomb). It does not have a nuclear yield (no atomic blast). The primary impact is contamination, panic, and area denial, not physical destruction of the city.
    </details>

2. **Explain the concept of "Socio-Natural" hazards with an example.**
    <details>
    <summary>Click to see Key Points</summary>
    *   **Concept:** Socio-natural hazards are events that differ from purely natural hazards because their causes are deeply rooted in human activity and environmental mismanagement. Nature provides the trigger, but society loads the gun.
    *   **Example:** A landslide in a hill station.
        *   *Natural Component:* Rain and gravity.
        *   *Socio Component:* Illegal construction of hotels on steep slopes, deforestation for roads, and lack of drainage.
        *   *Result:* The slope fails not just because it rained, but because human activity weakened it. This is a socio-natural hazard.
