# Unit II: Landscape Evolution & Dynamics

## Introduction

While Unit I focused on foundations, Unit II shifts the focus to **long-term change**. Landscape evolution is not a static state but a continuous, dynamic process. This unit explores the systematic mechanisms of landform progression through critical phases: **Erosion (Degradation)**, **Transport**, and **Deposition (Aggradation)**. It also emphasizes the role of environmental stressors and the geological framework in shaping the Earth's topography.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

1. **Map the Cycle:** detailed understanding of the Disaster Management Cycle and its phases.
2. **Plan Effective Responses:** Identify critical activities required before, during, and after a disaster.
3. **Empower Communities:** Understand the bottom-up approach of Community Based Disaster Preparedness (CBDP).
4. **Know the Stakeholders:** Recognize the specific roles and mandates of key agencies like NDMA, NDRF, OSDMA, and NGOs.

## Unit Outline

* **[Pre-disaster Planning](pre-disaster-planning.md)**: Readiness, risk assessment, and early warning.
* **[During Disaster Management](during-disaster-management.md)**: Emergency response, SAR, and relief.
* **[Post-disaster Planning and Development](post-disaster-planning.md)**: Recovery, reconstruction, and "Building Back Better".
* **[Community Based Disaster Preparedness](community-preparedness.md)**: Strengthening the first responders.
* **[Role of Stakeholders](stakeholders.md)**: Institutional frameworks (NGO, GO, NDMA, NIDM, NDRF, ODRAF, OSDMA).
