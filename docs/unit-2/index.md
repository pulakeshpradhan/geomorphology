# Unit II: Disaster Management Cycle

## Introduction

While Unit I focused on concepts, Unit II shifts the focus to **action**. Disaster Management is not a static event but a continuous, dynamic cycle. This unit explores the systematic process of managing disasters through three critical phases: **Pre-disaster (Preparation)**, **During-disaster (Response)**, and **Post-disaster (Recovery)**. It also emphasizes the critical role of community preparedness and the institutional framework in India.
