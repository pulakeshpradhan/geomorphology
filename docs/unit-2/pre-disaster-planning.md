# Pre-Disaster Planning

Pre-disaster planning is the phase where actions are taken before a disaster strikes to ensure readiness.

## Components of Pre-Disaster Planning

### 1. Risk Assessment and Monitoring

* **Hazard Mapping:** Identifying potential hazards in an area.
* **Early Warning Systems (EWS):**
  * *Example:* **IMD's SATARK** system in Odisha regarding cyclones.

### 3. Preparedness

Preparedness involves building the capacity to respond effectively.

* **Contingency Planning:** Developing specific plans (e.g., District Disaster Management Plans - DDMPs).
* **Mock Drills:** Conducting mock drills (e.g., annual nationwide drills by NDRF).
